## Requiriments

**Create a JSON API using the HTTP module that handles a server for a blog.**
The API should be able to handle:

- [ ] Creating a blog post.
- [ ] Updating a blog post
- [ ] Deleting a blog post
- [ ] Retrieving a single blog post based on an identifier.
- [ ] Retrieve a list of blog posts ordered from most recent to older.
- [ ] MongoDB must be used as storage solution.
- [ ] All post must be stored to database.
- [ ] No authentications or security restrictions are needed..

As an extra point add a way to add comments to each publication.

The API should be able to handle the same use cases for a comment as a blog post, the difference is that comments are scoped per blog post.
